## Environment

This is the PyTorch code of the VRR. The code has been tested on PyTorch 1.13.1. To install the dependencies, run

```bash
conda create -n vrr python=3.7
conda activate vrr
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Acknowledgement

The implementation of VRR relies on resources from [BLIP](https://github.com/salesforce/BLIP), [BERTScore](https://github.com/Tiiiger/bert_score). We thank the original authors for their open-sourcing.
